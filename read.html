      <h2>1. The Magic of Whole Spices</h2>
      <p>
        The true flavor of biryani lies in the use of whole spices like cloves, cardamom, bay leaves, and cinnamon. Toasting them in ghee or oil releases an aroma that forms the soul of every bite.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Layering is an Art</h2>
      <p>
        Authentic biryani is built in layersâ€”fragrant basmati rice, succulent meat or vegetables, caramelized onions, mint, and saffron milk. Each layer holds flavor and fragrance, creating a perfect harmony.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Marination Magic</h2>
      <p>
        We marinate our meat for hours using yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, spices, and a touch of lemon juice. This ensures the meat remains juicy, tender, and deeply flavorful.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Dum Cooking Tradition</h2>
      <p>
        Dum, the slow-cooking technique where biryani is sealed and simmered over low heat, locks in moisture and enhances the aromatic experience. We still follow this age-old technique for perfection.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Fragrant Saffron Infusion</h2>
      <p>
        A few strands of saffron soaked in warm milk not only add vibrant color but bring a regal fragrance that elevates the biryani experience to royalty.
